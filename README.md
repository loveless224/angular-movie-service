# Movie Finder

This project is a Movie Finder application that integrates with TheMovieDB API to display a list of movies along with their details, including videos, such as trailers. The back-end is built using **Java Spring Boot**, and the front-end is implemented using **Angular**. The app allows users to browse movies, view detailed information about each movie, and watch trailers.

## Features

- **Movie Details**: Shows detailed information about a selected movie, including the title, release date, genres, and a brief description.
- **Video Playback**: Allows users to watch trailers of the movies directly from the UI.
- **Search**: Users can search for movies by title, filtering the results to find specific movies.
